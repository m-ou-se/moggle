Moggle currently is split up in three parts:

1. Moggle Math [Header only]
   Provides matrix and vector types, and everything that's related.
   Does not depend on OpenGL or on another part of Moggle, so can be used separately.

2. Moggle Core [Header only]
   A very thin wrapper around OpenGL. Provides classes such as 'vbo', 'vao' and 'shader'.

3. Moggle XXX
   A very sexy and easy way to use OpenGL.
   It has advanced features such as shader pipelines and more.


Moggle is made by Mara Bos <m-ou.se@m-ou.se>.
